3. **Tertiary**: sessionStorage (session backup) 
4. **Emergency**: Memory storage (always available)

## Files Included
- `index.html` - Main app HTML
- `style.css` - Complete styling with responsive design
- `app.js` - Bulletproof storage implementation
- `manifest.json` - PWA configuration
- `logo.png` - App icon (you need to add your custom logo)

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Simple Web Server
1. Place all files in a web server directory
2. Ensure `logo.png` is your custom app icon (192x192 or 512x512 pixels)
3. Access via your domain/server

### Option 2: Local Testing
1. Use a simple HTTP server (not file:// protocol)
2. Python: `python -m http.server 8080`
3. Node.js: `npx serve .`
4. Access via `http://localhost:8080`

### Option 3: Deploy to Hosting
- Upload all files to any web hosting service
- Works with GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.
- Make sure HTTPS is enabled for PWA features

## Installation on Mobile
1. Open the app URL in Chrome (Android) or Safari (iOS)
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" or install prompt
3. App will work offline with full storage capabilities

## Storage Health Indicators
- **IDB** (IndexedDB): Green = working, Red = failed
- **LS** (localStorage): Green = working, Red = failed  
- **SS** (sessionStorage): Green = working, Red = failed
- **MEM** (Memory): Always green (built-in fallback)

Your data is safe even if some storage methods fail!
